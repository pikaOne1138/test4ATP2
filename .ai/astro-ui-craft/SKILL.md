# Astro UI Craft

Build websites that feel designed, not merely generated.

## Core model
Two content architectures:
- Knowledge / Blog
- Helper / Professional Service

Four visual personalities:
- Paper & Ink
- Morning Light
- Quiet Studio
- Botanical Calm

Treat this as **2 architectures × 4 visual directions = 8 demos**, not eight unrelated codebases.

## Scope guardrail
Default scope is a polished front-end site. Prefer external forms, LINE, booking and newsletter services. Do not silently expand into CRM, auth, member systems, custom booking engines, payments, databases or SaaS administration.

## Evidence hierarchy
1. Directly opened / screenshot / computed-CSS observations.
2. Web-searched and page-verified observations.
3. Cross-case patterns derived from verified cases.
4. Design proposals and synthesized tokens.
5. Memory-only or explicitly unverified candidate lists.

## Knowledge / Blog page job
Answer:
- What does this person write about?
- Where should a new reader start?
- How do I find more on a topic?
- Why should I follow them?
- What is the next low-friction action?

Default flow:
`Hero → Start Here/topics → featured/latest → short About → resource → newsletter → Footer`

## Helper / Professional page job
Answer:
- Am I in the right place?
- Does this person understand my situation?
- What do they offer?
- What happens if I contact them?
- Why can I trust them?
- What is the next low-pressure action?

Default flow:
`Hero → empathy → services → first-visit/process → About/credentials → trust → FAQ → booking/contact → Footer`

Prefer roughly **7 ± 1 meaningful sections**.

## Visual personalities
### Paper & Ink
Warm paper, dark ink, serif display type, fine rules, low-saturation imagery, editorial lists.

### Morning Light
Cream, clay/rose/sage accents, soft serif + readable sans, generous radii, natural-light imagery, gentle reassurance.

### Quiet Studio
Near-white warm gray, precise grid, sans-forward type, one strong accent, thin borders, structured service/content metadata.

### Botanical Calm
Soft botanical greens, restrained natural contrast, generous whitespace, and quiet organic warmth. Reuse existing tokens in `public/demo.css`; do not independently invent palette values.

## Typography and spacing contract (mandatory)
**優先遵守既定字級與間距系統，AI 不應隨意引入新的設計數值。**
- Before changing typography or spacing, inspect the project's actual CSS tokens, the three-style design research, and `references/component-library-v1.5.md`.
- Reuse existing font sizes, spacing steps, font weights, line heights, radii, and transitions for the applicable component/style.
- The established spacing steps are `4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128px`; apply them where appropriate rather than introducing arbitrary one-off values.
- Typography sizes are a separate scale from spacing. For the current v0.2 navbar use 16px standard links/CTA and 14px for Paper's editorial links; do not invent intermediary 15px without an explicit design decision.
- If a new value is genuinely necessary, explain why, centralize it as a token, and request approval before introducing it; do not silently modify the design system.
- Existing legacy values in styles are not blanket permission to invent more. A cleanup to full tokenization should be separate from an unrelated UI edit.

## Gallery and component discovery by purpose
- On `/blocks/`, organize components by **what visitors need to build** (shared navigation/search; homepage hero; general content; article discovery/lists; article reading/formatting; professional services/trust; complete site examples), never by release numbers.
- Versions belong in developer documentation and registry metadata only. For AI selection, search the registry by intended use and actual compatible page, rather than relying on which version introduced a block.
- Reuse live interactive examples in the appropriate section. Global search belongs under shared navigation; article tags/month/calendar belong under article discovery; table of contents and rich-text blocks belong under reading/formatting.

## V2 article exploration and rich-content blocks
- Version identifiers (V1.5/V2/V3) belong in developer docs, code comments, changelog and Skill references. On public-facing demo pages, describe actual capabilities without exposing internal implementation version numbers.
- Read `references/article-exploration-v2.md` when working on article search, tags, archives, calendars, lists, foldouts, grids, callouts, tables, related reading, or carousels.
- Use the shared `src/data/articles-v2.ts` schema and `src/site-map.ts` routes. Counts, dates, links and matches must derive from real article data.
- `SiteSearchDialog` provides magnifying-glass full-site **navigation index** popup (site pages, articles, services) with Ctrl+K/⌘K and Esc. It must preserve site kind/theme and display real targets; it is not full-body search.
- Current V2 `/explore/` supports metadata search, **not full-body search**. Never misrepresent its scope.
- Maintain existing typography, spacing and motion tokens in V2 components; do not introduce arbitrary design values.

## Component library (mandatory before page assembly)
- Read `references/component-library-v1.5.md` first for the catalog, scope, variants, and design integration rules.
- Read `COMPONENTS.md` and `src/data/blocks.registry.json` for the maintained component names, use cases and registry.
- Read the actual `src/components/blocks/*.astro` Props/source before importing or changing components. These files are the implementation source of truth; this reference is a guide, not a duplicate registry.
- Use `public/demo.css`, `public/blocks.css`, and `public/v02.css` as applicable, maintaining the same 4 design personalities. Preserve the original six routes and the two Botanical routes.
- Prioritize reusing existing Astro blocks and components. Add a new block only when existing Props and variants cannot satisfy a real requirement.
- Do not include V2 search/carousels or V3 auto-composition engine by default.

## Refined UI rules
- Structure before decoration.
- Consistent spacing scale.
- Long-form measure roughly 60–72ch.
- One primary accent + neutrals.
- Consistent image ratios and tonal treatment.
- Visible hover/focus/active feedback.
- Avoid neon purple, excessive glassmorphism, random bento grids, repeated icon-three-column sections, giant vague gradients, gratuitous counters/carousels/typewriter effects.

## Navigation
Desktop: `[Logo] 4–5 links ... [single primary CTA]`
- Knowledge: Articles / Topics / Start Here / About + Subscribe.
- Helper: Services / Process / About / Articles / FAQ + Book/Contact.
- Avoid mega menus for the workshop baseline.

## CTA
At most three semantic levels:
- Primary: Subscribe OR Book an intro.
- Secondary: understand fit/process/free resource.
- Low-pressure: read/explore/learn more.

Helper language: “預約初談”, “了解合作方式”, “第一次來？先看看流程”, “開始聊聊”.

## Motion
- hover 150–220ms
- UI transitions 180–350ms
- reveal 400–650ms
- movement 4–16px
- scale ~0.98–1.03
- consistent ease-out
- prefer transform + opacity
- respect prefers-reduced-motion

The intended effect: users may not consciously notice animation, but the site feels cared for.

## Responsive
Do not merely shrink desktop.
- Desktop: ~1080–1200px container.
- Tablet: simplify split layouts/sticky side content.
- Mobile: single reading flow, generous side padding, full-width controls where helpful.
- Helper can use a persistent booking CTA only if it does not cover content.

## Quality gate
Before handoff:
- primary page job is obvious;
- hierarchy reads correctly without decoration;
- mobile composition works;
- contrast/tap targets/focus states are usable;
- motion is subtle and optional;
- build succeeds;
- no accidental backend scope creep.

## Practical interactive blocks and real services
Use `.ai/astro-ui-craft/references/article-exploration-v2.md` practical-block guidance for MobileMenu, BookingLink, ContactActions, PricingDetails, TrustInfo, MediaEmbed. Do not create fake form submissions, invented third-party appointments, testimonials or credentials. Keep GitHub Actions PR previews, and obtain user consent before merge.

## Social identity links
Use reusable `SocialLinks.astro` for social platforms and contact identity, rather than hardcoding text links or inventing brand URLs. Accept only configured HTTPS destinations or explicitly validated mailto/tel. Include aria labels and visible keyboard focus; preserve current four themes and do not show missing profiles. `ContactActions` wraps `SocialLinks` with LINE/Email/phone when data exists. Keep icon-brand trademark/individual license considerations in component docs; avoid user-facing release numbers.

### Refined social icons in site headers
Compose `SiteSearchDialog` + narrow divider + `SocialLinks size="sm"` on the desktop navbar via `SiteNav`'s optional `socialLinks` list. Do not duplicate nav links or crowd narrow screens; social icons are hidden below 850px. Use single-color CSS mask icons that inherit theme foreground/accent, subtle focus, consistent spacing, and no invented account links. Header can opt out with `socialLinks={[]}`. Demo defaults show verified GitHub repo + deployed demo site only.

Mobile menu `MobileMenu` accepts the same `socialLinks` array as desktop `SiteNav`; render its SocialLinks beneath all mobile nav items, separated by a subtle hairline, with 44px icon tap targets and no fabricated URLs. Do not hide all social access on mobile; only hide the desktop duplicate. Keep dialog keyboard and focus behavior.


## Current practical block implementation
Branch `feat/v2-5-reading-sharing` adds Breadcrumbs、ArticleNavigation、ArticleShare、ReadingProgress. 文章頁 Breadcrumbs、上一篇／下一篇、LINE／Facebook／Email／剪貼簿分享、實際文章區域的閱讀進度。不能將 SocialLinks 當成文章分享。 Reuse the existing paper/morning/studio/botanical design tokens and functional /blocks/ category layout. Do not show internal version numbers on visitor-facing pages. No fake inputs, services, professional qualifications, media links, emergency contacts, or newsletter submissions. Preserve BASE_URL and PR-preview-first workflow.

## Practical component batch feat/v2-5-resources-newsletter
Add ResourceCard、ResourceLibrary、LeadMagnetCard、NewsletterSignup. 可設定真實資源網址；沒有電子報服務不得假裝表單已成功送出。 Preserve Astro static build, four theme tokens, BASE_URL, actual links, keyboard focus, mobile and reduced-motion. Keep functional block gallery and registry aligned; no automatic merge or fabricated user-facing content.

## Practitioner-specific helper demo copy
Do not reuse generic vague 'companionship, exploration, talk it through' filler for all helper sites. Four **sample content identities** live at `src/data/helper-content.ts`: paper=bodywork, morning=counseling psychology, studio=coaching, botanical=Reiki. Cover distinct method, informed consent and scope, service cards, fit/not-fit, first visit, FAQ and booking. They illustrate varied real-world use cases, **not a hard link between theme and profession**. Never invent qualifications or treatment efficacy; Reiki must be presented as non-medical wellness practice, counseling requires legally appropriate license, bodywork requires explicit physical-contact consent, and coaching does not replace therapy.


## Article index layout and mobile navigation
For article archives use the shared `ArticleViewSwitcher.astro` with list/cards/grid layouts rather than implementing new duplicated archives. List is editorial ruled rows, cards are spacious two-column blocks, grid is a dense three-column typography-led index. Four visual themes reuse existing tokens; on small screens they collapse to one column. Keep articles, search, tags, calendar and month browsing connected to real routes. In mobile site navigation, use a 44px hamburger SVG-only button with an accessible name, alongside the existing search icon; keep full links and social icons inside the dialog. Do not repeat 'find articles' when an Articles nav link exists.


## Motion and interaction craft
When asked to refine scrolling reveal, stagger, hover tilt/spotlight, image zoom/pan, magnetic CTA, animated underline or FAQ open transitions, first follow `.ai/astro-motion-craft/SKILL.md` and `.ai/astro-motion-craft/references/manus-v2-motion-map.md`. The Manus v2 files are reference material, not installed components. Favor existing four theme variables, unobtrusive editorial motion, progressive enhancement and mobile/reduced-motion fallback over importing a separate Tailwind theme.


## Reusable motion effects library
The reusable motion research + integration library lives in `.ai/astro-motion-craft/library/`. When generating or enhancing UI motion, read that catalog and relevant source-grounded recipe first, along with `.ai/astro-motion-craft/SKILL.md`; do not generate novel hover/reveal logic while equivalent existing components are available. Manus v2 references are not automatically installed runtime effects.


## Common long-page navigation: BackToTop
For long landing pages, article archives and document views reuse `BackToTop` through the shared DemoLayout. It belongs to the common blocks registry, not the effects registry. Ensure the right-bottom control appears only after meaningful scrolling, stays clear of safe areas and overlays, has a keyboard accessible name, and returns to the page top instantly if the visitor prefers reduced motion. Avoid duplicating event listeners in child pages.


## Layout selection (a third gallery)
Use `.ai/astro-layout-craft/SKILL.md` for whole-page reading flow and structural layouts. `/layouts/` offers 12 independent homepage compositions, deliberately different from the 2×4 theme palette previews. When composing a new real client site, select layout first, then reuse blocks and relevant Motion Skill effects, and only then tune colors and brand assets. Do not claim the 12 static prototypes are complete CMS-backed websites.


## Claude 構圖配方不是功能元件

`src/components/editorial-recipes/` 為 40 個純構圖配方（H01–H12、S01–S08、L01–L06、R01–R06、C01–C08），配方展示在 `/layouts/recipes/`。這與 `/blocks/` 登錄的功能 blocks 不同：先依 `astro-layout-craft`／`astro-editorial-layout-design` 選版型／構圖，再以 UI blocks 補真正的文章、預約、搜尋、表單等功能。配方若只有視覺 placeholder 不得宣稱功能已接上。


## External library assessment — avoid rebuilding solved UI primitives

Before implementing a **generic interface behavior** (Dialog, Dropdown, Mega Menu, Tabs, Accordion, Sheet, Tooltip, Focus management):
1. Search the existing `src/data/blocks.registry.json`, `src/components/blocks/`, and `src/components/patterns/`. Reuse the current system when functionally suitable.
2. Check the research directory `src/data/external-ui-libraries.json` (presented below `/blocks/`) for established native-Astro and CSS-first alternatives.
3. Prefer minimal, auditable components that preserve static HTML by default, accessible keyboard behavior, reduced-motion preferences, tokens, and phone layout.
4. Check **actual upstream license**, package versions, maintenance, security, styles and JavaScript/hydration cost before importing code. The directory is research only: listing a library does not authorize installation.
5. Record why a library was adopted, adapted, or rejected, including new dependencies and migration impact. Don't mix several competing theming systems into the student Starter without a strong reason.
6. Use Branch + PR; test 1440/1280/768/390 and keyboard/touch behavior. A passed Astro build is not visual QA.

Our Blocks and Section Patterns still represent **site-specific tasks and content structure**. The external UI libraries primarily provide general-purpose visual and interaction primitives, not workshop-specific trust/SEO/content requirements.
